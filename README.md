This is my beginnings of a simple 2D world. Right now I have created an abstract Object class that can be
inherited by other classes and then put into the world. I plan on testing some artificial intelligence in the world. 
Basically, I wanted to build a simple platform that I can abstract away the graphics and focus on designing intelligent
agents. Hopefully, I can get to that point in the near future.
